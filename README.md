# SimTime2RW
This tool allows you to set the UTC time in P3D/FSX to whatever you desire or easily set the it to real world time. 

It also allows you to set times in the simulator such as 'TOD' and it will tell you when they will fall on real world times.
This is particularly useful if you aren't flying with real world time.
